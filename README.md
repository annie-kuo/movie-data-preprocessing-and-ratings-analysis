# movie-data-preprocessing-and-ratings-analysis
This program analyses the data collected from [FlixGem](https://flixgem.com/) to determine the predictors for Hidden Gem Scores (HGS) of movies and computes the H-indices of directors. The former part is based heavily on plotting and uses regression trees.

## Features
- Performs data wrangling on the raw data.
- Evaluates the association between the HGS and the *Runtime Category*.
- Evaluates the association between the HGS and the *Language*.
- Evaluates the association between the HGS and the scores assessed by *IMDb*, *Roten Totamotes*, and *Metacritic*.
- Determines if people are becoming more acceptable of longer movies since the rising of Netflix (upward trend in HGS).
- Attributes an H-index for directors and ranks them accordingly.
- Produces a table depicting the top 10 directors.
